## What is arkd?

`arkd` is the server implementation of Arkade instance that builds on top of the Ark protocol, a Bitcoin scaling solution that enables fast, low-cost off-chain transactions while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees. As an Arkade Operator, the server:

- Creates and manages Batch Outputs through on-chain Bitcoin transactions
- Facilitates off-chain transactions between users
- Provides liquidity for commitment transactions (on-chain settlements that finalize each batch)

The Operator's role is designed with strict boundaries that ensure users always maintain control over their funds. This architecture allows for efficient transaction batching while preserving the trustless nature of Bitcoin.


## Supported Networks and Wallets

`arkd` supports the following Bitcoin network:
* regtest
* testnet3
* signet
* mutinynet
* mainnet

and uses [lnwallet](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/lnwallet/btcwallet) as embedded on-chain wallet.

## Usage Documentation

In this documentation, you'll learn how to install and use `arkd`, a Bitcoin server for off-chain Bitcoin transactions.

### Installing from GitHub Releases

   ```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH (optional):
   ```sh
   sudo mv arkd /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Provisioning

### Data Directory

By default, `arkd` stores all data in the following location:

- Linux: `~/.arkd/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/arkd/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\arkd\`

You can specify a custom data directory using the `ARKD_DATADIR` environment variable.

### Connecting to Bitcoin

#### Option 1: Connect to Bitcoin Core via RPC

To connect `arkd` to your own Bitcoin Core node via RPC, use these environment variables:

```sh
export ARKD_WALLET_BITCOIND_RPC_USER=admin1
export ARKD_WALLET_BITCOIND_RPC_PASS=123
export ARKD_WALLET_BITCOIND_RPC_HOST=localhost:18443
```

For ZMQ notifications (recommended for better performance):

```sh
export ARKD_WALLET_BITCOIND_ZMQ_BLOCK=tcp://localhost:28332
export ARKD_WALLET_BITCOIND_ZMQ_TX=tcp://localhost:28333
```

#### Option 2: Connect via Neutrino

For a lighter setup using Neutrino (BIP 157/158):

```sh
export ARKD_WALLET_NEUTRINO_PEER=yourhost:p2p_port_bitcoin
```

If none of the above options are specified, the wallet uses Neutrino by default with peer discovery.

### Wallet Setup

1. Start the wallet:
   ```sh
   arkd-wallet
   ```

2. Start arkd:
   ```sh
   arkd
   ```

3. Create a new wallet:
   ```sh
   arkd wallet create --password <password>
   ```

   Or restore from mnemonic:
   ```sh
   arkd wallet create --mnemonic "your twelve word mnemonic phrase here" --password <password>
   ```

4. Unlock the wallet:
   ```sh
   arkd wallet unlock --password <password>
   ```

5. Generate a funding address:
   ```sh
   arkd wallet address
   ```

6. Fund the on-chain address with BTC and wait for at least 2 confirmations.

7. Check your wallet balance:
   ```sh
   arkd wallet balance
   ```

8. Withdraw funds from your wallet:
   ```sh
   arkd wallet withdraw --address <address> --amount <amount_in_btc>
   ```

For a complete list of available commands and options:
   ```sh
   arkd --help
   ```

## Development

### Compile binary from source

To compile the `arkd` binary from source, you can use the following Make commands from the root of the repository:

- `make build`: Builds the `arkd` binary for your platform.
- `make build-all`: Builds the `arkd` binary for all platforms.

### Contributing Guidelines

1. **No force pushing in PRs**: Always use `git push --force-with-lease` to avoid overwriting others' work.
2. **Sign your commits**: Use GPG to sign your commits for verification.
3. **Squash and merge**: When merging PRs, use the "Squash and merge" option to maintain a clean commit history.
4. **Testing**: Add tests for each new major feature or bug fix.
5. **Keep master green**: The master branch should always be in a passing state. All tests must pass before merging.

### Local Development Setup

1. Install Go (version 1.23 or later)
2. Install [Nigiri](https://nigiri.vulpem.com/) for local Bitcoin networks
3. Start Nigiri to setup a regtest Bitcoin environment:

   ```sh
   nigiri start
   ```

4. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd.git
   cd arkd
   ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
